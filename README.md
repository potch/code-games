# Code from the Mozilla Chill Games Developer Medley

This is the code used to power the Developer Medley event, which you can watch here: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/229422697

It's pretty hacked-together, but (mostly) worked for two rounds! :)

## To Run

```
npm install
node server.js
```

The "player" is found at `/`.

The scoreboard can be found at `/status.html`, and the control interface is at `/control.html`.
